Heya! I'm {{page.author}}, bringing the latest updates about Heavensbake's projects and team.

## Melissa Drive, goals updates and financial complications

Home and personal expenses been growing more than incomes, unfortunately. That made me rethink about the current goals for [Mel's donation drive](/film/melissa-preggo-drive) and dedicate even more time working on the studio's operation model for the sake of my future as an entrepreneur and its future in bringing quality pregnancy entertainment.

Given the animations' look increased significantly and the average goals for well hand-drawn drives (which aren't even animated) are equal or greater than $100, I think it's fair at least to double the goal for each of the stages starting from the 7th one.

The 4, 5 and 6th will be delivered without the increase, and the 10th will have an even bigger goal of $500, considering it'll be a different, special clip.

Thanks everyone for understanding and thanks once again for supporting the studio with your donations, feedbacks and shares.

\~ Tei.
