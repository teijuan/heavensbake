Special thanks to Gerplexan for creating and promoting the contest for which this work was created, but more than that, created the opportunity which activated this whole new venture called **Heavensbake**.

## Trivia
> 
> Marian's appearance wasn't planned for this piece in the early stages of production, and her model is a modified version of Robin
