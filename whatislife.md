What is life?  
Is it only giving?  
What is life?  
Is it only living?  
  
Who am I?  
Is it this for real?  
I only know how foolish I feel  
  
What is life?  
Is it only giving?  
What is life?     
Is it only living?  
  
I go through every day  
Trying to face tomorrow  
Trying not to run away  
With too much sorrow  
  
What is life?  
Is it only giving?  
What is life?  
Is it only living?  
  
Who am I?  
Is it this for real?
I only know how sad I feel
