# Mission and values

> An indie studio, market leader in adult entertainment focused on pregnancy and motherhood concepts, with a major focus on storytelling rather than mature appealing.

Personally, I (Tei) believe that everyone is free to feel good, don't feel misjudged or be afraid of expressing your feelings or fantasies, while respecting moral and ethic values that make up a society.

I found a safe place in the preg / pregfur fandom to express my ideas.


\~ Tei.
